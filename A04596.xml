         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE manifold exhortations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the ſecurity of theſe times, are reaſons ſufficient both to command and encourage his ſervants to be watchfull, and to awaken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both by voice and writings, that they hold the times of death and iudgement before their eyes: yet for mine owne particular J have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons leading me unto this forwardneſſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſing, but alſo enforceing me to the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of this preſent Treatiſe. Firſt, J was not

able by writing to ſatisfie the importunity of thoſe who heard ſome of it delivered, nor of thoſe unto whom (upon intreaty) ſome of it was communicated, except it had beene publiſhed. Secondly, I conſidered, that the ſame Scripture was not particularly handled by any either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or moderne, (ſo farre as J can learne) though Commentatours have given briefe notes upon it; which moved me the rather to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this Expoſition, or by my raſhneſſe to ſtirre up others more learned, to give ſufficient contentment unto ſuch, who by this motion may be ſet on longing. Thirdly, the diſpoſition of men requires, that in ſo neceſſary a ſubiect they have not onely admonition in words, but that there remaine a daily admoniſher ſtanding in ſight: yea they who loathe repetition of one thing, yet love to reade often over ſuch things as they finde to move their conſciences: unto which may be added Saint <hi>Peters</hi> example, who <hi>endeavoured not by word alone,</hi>

J dare not (as building a ſtately gate for lowly cottages) invite the Readers with goodly promiſes, ſeeing I am conſcious of mine owne weakneſſe and unability to performe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need I intreate the zealous Chriſtian; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title, the ſubiect, and his owne deſire to Gods word, are incitements ſufficient unto him.

               <p>If you demand, why theſe that are to meete Chriſt are called Virgins? I anſwer, becauſe this is a compariſon of Marriage, in which onely Virgins, choſen and appointed, went out to meet the Bridegroome. But if you aske, which of all them that ſhall meete Chriſt is his Spouſe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,<note place="margin">Who is the Spouſe of Chriſt.</note> Every ſoule, that hath in this life waſhed himſelfe from ſinne by repentance, and calling on the name of the Lord, and prepared himſelfe, with a confidence in the ſweete love and mercy of God, ſhall be the ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt. But to ſpeake (as the Scripture doth) all the Elect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who agree in unity of one faith and love to Ieſus Chriſt, are his one and undivided Spouſe: from which notwithſtanding, we may not conceive, an equality of dignity and love to be in the Church, to be worthy the uniting unto the glorious God, who for worth, is Lord of heaven and earth, and of love beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,<note place="margin">Ioh 15 13.</note> for <hi>no man can ſhew greater love for his friend, than to give his life for him,</hi> Chriſt ſhewed greater,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> in <hi>giving his life for his enemies.</hi> And though all the faithfull cannot bee ſufficiently meet for to be his Spouſe, yet are they counted worthy,<note place="margin">Philip. 3 9.</note> when they are conſidered as joyned to Chriſt, and one with him, and are ſeene of God, not with their owne righteouſneſſe, but cloathed

and overſhadowed with the worth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We are to obſerve two things: 1,<note place="margin">Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants called Virgins.</note> that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule is called a Virgin. Chriſt a Virgin, the Sonne of a Virgin, will have a Virgin to his Spouſe. But what kinde of Virgin?<note place="margin">Hieron. in Epiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Virginis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitio est, ſanctam eſſe corpore &amp; mente:</hi> A Virgin is one that is holy both in minde and body; in minde, becauſe the Lord doth (in this Parable) condemne the corrupted mindes of the fooliſh Virgins, whoſe bodies were not corrupted: in body,<note place="margin">1 Cor 6.15.19</note> becauſe an uncleane body cannot be the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, nor member of Chriſt. But if wee conſider why Gods Church was called a Virgin, wee ſhall the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what is here meant by a Virgin. God from the beginning, ever ſhewed himſelfe unto the people that were his, as if he had beene their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or ſpouſe: unto the Iewes, he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a husband; unto the Chriſtian Church, he ſhewed himſelfe a ſpouſe: the Iewes he tooke to him, when their fathers were Idolaters,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 24.2.</note> and themſelves too; hee married himſelfe to them, who by Idolatry had loſt their Virginity; who notwithſtanding, after they came to ſerve God, fell to Idolatry many times againe, &amp; provoked him to wrath: therefore he, in the Prophets, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, that they had committed adultery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; in ſtead of the living and true God, they bowed, kiſſed, and offered ſacrifice to Idols, conſecrated to the honour of Divels, or damned men: ſo they who before wanted ſpirituall Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8262:10"/>
fell from matrimonial chaſtity.<note place="margin">Chriſts Spouſe to be free from Idolatry.</note> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hath hee betrothed unto himſelfe for his Spouſe, as Virgins, becauſe hee tooke no notice of the olde Gentiles Idolatry, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tolde the <hi>Athenians</hi> of their Idolatry,<note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> that <hi>the time of that ignorance God regarded not.</hi> Therefore, are they all Virgins, becauſe they worſhip God in truth. Another condition is required of the ſpirituall Virgin,<note place="margin">And free from pride Eſay 66.2.</note> that he be humble: Vpon whom will I looke ſaith the Lord? <hi>Even upon the lowly in heart:</hi> This the bleſſed Virgin knew wel, when ſhe ſaid, that God looked upon the <hi>lowlineſſe of his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, we have to obſerve, that the faithfull ſoule is eſpouſed or betrothed to Chriſt Ieſus. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 5 23.</note> that as the husband is to the wife, ſo is Chriſt to his Church; that is, he is husband: it is true in effect.<note place="margin">The faithfull ſoule is betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to Chriſt.</note> But if wee conſider what is to come, (our great Marriage) which beginneth to be ſolemnized at the day when our ſoules goe to glory, and conſummate, when both ſoules and body goe thither, and our dwelling for ever in his houſe: we are but eſpouſed or betrothed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him;<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.2.</note> for as yet he is <hi>gone before us, to prepare a place for us.</hi> This, the name of Spouſe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,<note place="margin">Bern. in Locum.</note> for <hi>Sponſus,</hi> is <hi>à ſpondendo,</hi> from promiſing, that either ſhall keepe themſelves for other.

he doth to all other his faithfull ſervants, whom by the miniſtery of St. <hi>Paul</hi> he betrothed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this doctrine may be knowne,<note place="margin">That hee may love and long for Chriſt the more.</note> by the uſe of betrothing, that a certaine time, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, ſometimes leſſe, being ſet betweene it and the Marriage day, the love of both might be increaſed, by the earneſt deſire of their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>Cupienti animae nihil ſatis feſtinatur;</hi>

                  </note> and this was that which made <hi>Iacob</hi> love <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> the better, who for ſeven yeares together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betrothing, was ſometimes faint with extreme worke, now burnt with the Sunne, another time frozen with colde, moſt time pined with ſcarſity, all times tormented betweene love to <hi>Rachell,</hi> and feare of <hi>Labans</hi> ſubtleties. So is it between Chriſt and us, we are by faith in eſpouſage joyned unto him, to the end, that our deſire and love unto him may more earneſtly wiſh for the full enjoying of him.

meeting verſ. 6. etc. The preparation is ſet down of all the Virgins, firſt in ſimilitude, then in diſſimilitude. In ſimilitude, all prepared their lampes, but in this they were unlike, for the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh prepared no oyle for the darkeneſſe of the night: the wiſe filled their lampes, &amp; becauſe they feared the length of the night, and long tarying of the Bridegroome, they filled their veſſells alſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, that I may ſpeake of their lampes, we muſt remember ſomewhat ſpoken of before, that this life is the time and place, in which ſome profeſſe that they are meeting Chriſt, and others are truely upon their journey, looking and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his comming, either by their departure to him, or his comming to them by iudgement. It is therefore agreed vpon by the conſent and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of all, both the ſervants of God and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſinne, that lampes are needfull to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for their journey, to inlighten them in this world, untill Chriſt who is the true light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, when wee ſhall not need Sunne, Moone, lampes, nor candles to direct vs. As the maides of the holy Land, even the unwiſeſt of them had this wit, that for celebrating a wedding, they had need of a lampe, &amp; that the Bridegroomes ſhould (according to cuſtome) come in the night-time (the naturall darkenes of the Creatures:) So all the Virgins,<note place="margin">The practiſe almoſt of all men ſheweth that our way to heaven is dark.</note> I meane all that are called by the name of Chriſtians, doe ſhew by their actions, that our journey and way to meet Chriſt is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally darke, and that we have neede of ſome light
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8262:15"/>
to ſhew vs the way. But that I appropriate not this truth only to true Chriſtians, who beſt know how darke this way is, I finde all (except them that are truely Atheiſts) to pronounce the ſame, and by their deedes ſhew that nature doth darken vs, in ſome errand which the ſoule of man of it ſelfe naturally intendeth. Our profaneſt ſort of profeſſed Chriſtians prove it who have taken and profeſſed Baptiſme and all the conditions of it, they avouch that Chriſt appertaineth to them ſo much as to any, they ſay that Gods word is true, and that of their owne knowledge, they knowe well enough both what it and the Miniſter can ſay; theſe therefore doe confeſſe the darknes and imperfection of Nature in this buſineſſe, and to have taken Lampes. Pagans alſo have eſpyed this; for to what purpoſe ſhould Turke, or any Savage, cary the love of any Religion with him, if hee thought not, that common naturall knowledge were imperfite herein, and that it were not able to direct and conduct the ſoule ſo farre as it is to goe? for he that would onely live, and dye with this life, needes not any ſort of Religion at all. But none of all this kinde are ſo blinded, but that they ſcorne to remaine content with the light of nature, and therefore will take one ſort of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or other by the end (as a lampe) to direct him, ſome way he ſhould go, but he knowes not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Onely the Atheiſt that is ſure (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) that there is no God, neither ſeeketh or profeſſeth any Lampe, becauſe he hath none that made him to whom he ſhould goe, except Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8262:16"/>
with whom he already remaineth: of all men his caſe is the ſtrangeſt, for hell which is utter darkneſſe to all that are damned, is the brighteſt Lampe that ever hee ſaw; for nothing could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhew him that there was or where there was a God, untill hell made him ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>But all others profeſſe that either they would have Lampes, as Turkes, and others the like; or that they have them, as the fooliſh Virgins or Chriſtians; or that they have them, and Oyle in them, as Gods true ſervants, declaring the want of light they conceive in the way betweene Chriſt and us.</p>
               <p>The uſe hereof is, that wee conſider how our ſoules bend further then this world, and further they will goe either right or wrong; and that we are not able by our owne judgements to enlighten or direct our ſelves in the way: and therefore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and miſerable is their caſe, that ſee or know no more concerning their eſtate, than their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes doe ſhew them; for know no more of the way to heaven, or of meeting Chriſt, than they did when they were children. The Heathen would gladly have Lampes, but God hath denied them; the fooliſh Virgins have Lampes, but have no Oyle: Take therefore this holy intent, and let it never goe out of your minde, that you are deſirous to meete Chriſt, and call to God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and direct you; untill you come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the preſence of God.</p>

               <p>Long ſtaying may be either in reſpect of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or expected time: although the time of Chriſts comming is not ſet downe, yet becauſe there were certaine marks given before he come, which ſome obſerving, others miſtaking, yet moſt of all inquirers, could never imagine that he ſhould have ſtayed ſo long: therefore not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as he was expected, hee is thought to ſtay long.</p>
               <p>In all the times when the Goſpell flouriſhed,<note place="margin">When Chriſt was expected, and the curious fouly deceived.</note> there were ſome that enquired for it, and ſome concluded the time, which came not to paſſe, the Lord thereby ſhewing the folly of their curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In St. <hi>Paules</hi> dayes, as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of learning were curious, ſo at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> eſpecially they began to beate their braines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, and becauſe St <hi>Paul</hi> had written in his firſt Epiſtle (chap. 4. verſ. 15.) <hi>For this I ſay by the word of the Lord, that wee who live ſhall not prevent them that ſleep;</hi> they preſently concluded that his comming was at hand: for repreſſing of which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8262:28"/>
opinion <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle unto them;<note place="margin">2 Theſſ: 2, 1, 2.</note> ſome ſaid that they knew it by revelation, others avouched that they heard it from Saint <hi>Paules</hi> mouth, others that they could ſhew his letters for it. A little after the Apoſtles dayes it was a common opinion among unconverted Gentiles,<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Civit. Dei lib: <hi>18,</hi> cap: <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> that the world ſhould ſtand 365 yeares. About the yeare of Chriſt 250, <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth to a friend of his,<note place="margin">Epiſt: ad Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum.</note> that the common opinion was, that the end was at hand, and in another letter ſaith his owne minde with application of it,<note place="margin">Ad Cecili: lib: <hi>2,</hi> Ep: <hi>3.</hi>

After the yeare 400, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> ſay, that many were of <hi>Lactantius</hi> minde, that even in their owne time Chriſt would come to judgement: and that St. <hi>Ierome</hi> was of this minde appeareth by his fearefull words,<note place="margin">In Regiſt: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach: cap: <hi>30.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8262:28"/>
All theſe expectations and conjectures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving falſe, Chriſt is ſaid to ſtay long. I have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved diverſe, who being curious to know and determine the time of the great Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were ſodainly themſelves taken away by death. Wherefore wee are to retaine onely the ſignes, and that modeſty to be beleeved, and daily expect it. But ſeeing many have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, even by miſtaking the ſignes themſelves, it may be asked, Which of them may wee take holde of as a marke, and not to be miſtaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his comming?</p>

Then on a ſodaine ſhall the Lord come, the heavens goe away with a noiſe, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements melt with heate, the earth fall a burning, the quicke and dead mount up to meete the Lord in the ayre.</p>
               <p>But when ſhall thoſe things come to paſſe? It
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8262:29"/>
can not certainely be knowne: but if it be asked,<note place="margin">When to come to paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, yet (as appeareth by example) may ſoone come.</note> how ſoone all this may be? I pray you conſider what alteration the Lord hath made in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſince <hi>Luther</hi> was taken notice of, but 112 yeares agoe; eſpecially what God hath done in Great Britaine in leſſe time, turned out the Prince of Babell, indued olde and young with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and other gifts of God, eſpecially inflamed their hearts with zeale, that they were readier to ſuffer torments, than their enemies were to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them upon them; filled all with knowledge, that none were hidde from the ſound of Gods word; and finally hath caſt them into ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that moſt have loſt the power &amp; ſtrength of religion, that no ſinne wants actours, no wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe but it hath excuſers, patrons, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hundreds of Preachers are become dumbe, and theſe beſt heard and befriended, that either cannot, or will not ſpeake a word in Gods name, and theſe who forewarne men of this ſtate, never taken notice of, what they ſay or command. O what a ſecurity is this! Certainely if the great Iudgement day were farre off, God could not ſuffer this ſo long. He therefore that conſidereth how God hath wrought theſe things in ſo ſhort a time, may eaſily ſee how ſoone the Lord can bring all the aforeſaid to paſſe, and haſten the Iudgement day.</p>
               <p>Now we are to make uſe of this:<note place="margin">Death and Iudgement go together.</note> I cannot think or ſpeake of this great day, but I muſt needes continually thinke of death, and therefore if any ſay that it is neare at hand, then I anſwere, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8262:30"/>
death muſt bring him thither: If he ſay that it is farre off, and ſhall not be theſe many hundred yeares, I anſwere, that death ſhall preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and pull him unto Iudgement: The world may ſtand long, but how knoweſt thou, but thou maiſt fall before to morrow? the great judgement may be farre, but thy judgement may be this night, and as death leaveth thee, the great judgement ſhall finde thee.<note place="margin">Death a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> Finally, ſo oft as thou ſeeſt one die, ſo many prophecies the Lord ſhews thee, foretelling the ruine of the whole world; in which, the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which is the light of the world) ſhall goe away with a noyſe,<note place="margin">2 Pet: 3.</note> &amp; in death <hi>(Vitaque cum gemitu fugit)</hi> the life which is the light of men) goeth likewiſe away with a groane.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Virg. AEneid</hi> 12 Iohn 1 4.</note> In the laſt day all the elements ſhall be confuſed &amp; leave their naturall operations: ſo in death, the parts of the elements whereof we be made, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and all dead without operation. In the laſt day the earth (which ſhall be the remainder of the world) muſt be overrunne with fire to purifie it: ſo in death, the carcaſſe, all the remainder of the whole man, muſt be purified by rotting, from the droſſe of corruption. Laſtly, in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day the ſoules are brought before the Lord in the ayre, to be tryed for all they did: ſo in death the ſoule is preſented before the Lord, where the Lord hath ſet up his ſeate of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore after tryall and ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſent either to heaven or hell.<note place="margin">Both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, both have ſignes going before.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides (as death doth ſhew thee the ſtate of the world,) ſo the knowledge that wee may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8262:30"/>
have of death, ſheweth what knowledge we may have of the judgement day. As the Lord hath hidden the knowledge of that day from men and Angells, ſo is the day of our death hidden from men and Angells: but as the Lord hath prefixed ſignes and markes to know when it approacheth, (if wee have eyes to ſee them) ſo the Lord hath foreſhewen ſignes in our bodie and behaviour, (if wee marke and obſerve them) which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie our mortalitie: And as blindneſſe ſhall overcome men in the end of the world, and they ſhall cry peace and ſafety, when ſodaine deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is comming: ſo when men are ſureſt to live long, to enjoy the world, and improve it to the moſt, then are they caught away, and we ſee them no more.</p>
               <p>I therefore intreate that all men would provide and ſtudy what concernes their death, when they thinke of the laſt comming of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both which this doctrine is to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The reaſon of Chriſts ſtay.</note> in both wee ſee (ofttimes) the Lord tary long; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us the reaſon, not that hee is ſlacke, or deſirous to put off the time, but that hee is patient towards us, and would have no man to periſh, but that all ſhould come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: the Lord hath ſome choſen to ſalvation, that are either unborne or uncalled, and therefore the judgement day cannot come untill this bee done. Againe, ſeeſt thou a wicked man to live long the Lord ſtayes to give him time to repent, which he not doing is made inexcuſable;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8262:31"/>
if God gave him repentance, then for this did the Lord ſuffer him to live. Know the reaſon why the Lord preſerves your life, even that you may have time to turne and amend: beware therefore that this time given for repentance be not uſed to the hardning of your hearts, and heaping up of judgement. And this was the cauſe why the great judgement came not long agoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Time uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that we may prepare.</note>Secondly, you ſee that the Lord will have the time of death and judgement uncertaine, leſt we conceiving the Lord giveth us time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhould convert and uſe it to our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that being certaine that they ſhall come, but uncertaine of the time, wee may prepare our ſelves, ſhake off ſinne more ſpeedily, and avoid it more carefully. Are we then uncertaine of the time when we ſhall die and be brought to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Firſt then let us be ever prepared; Chriſt compareth the uncertainty of them to a ſnare,<note place="margin">Luke 21, 35. Mat: 24, 43.</note> that ſhall come upon the inhabitants of the earth; likewiſe Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3, 10. 2 Theſſ: 5, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> compare them to the unexpected comming of a theef; Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them to the flood in <hi>Noahs</hi> time:<note place="margin">Mat: 24, 37.</note> O then how prepared ought we to be? For if the bird feared the ſnare, if the goodman feared the theef, if the world would feare an univerſall flood to drowne them; what providence, how many lockes, how many watches would be uſed, and how many prayers would be ſaid? When the Spouſe is uncertaine of her husbands comming, how is her ſleepe broken in the night, her labour hindred in the day, with thinking on him! So
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8262:31"/>
ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 21, 35.</note> Watch therefore (for the day when you ſhall goe to your Lord, or your Lord come to you) that you may be accounted worthy to ſtand before the Sonne of man in his comming. Secondly,<note place="margin">And ſhake off ſinne.</note> ſeeing the time of death and judgement are uncertaine, take the Wiſemans Counſell, Make no delay in turning to the Lord, and put not off from day to day, &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> 5.7. If the King were to give one pardon for life, or a grant for preferment, upon condition to have his patent ingroſſed in one day, what haſte would he make? It may be that thou ſeeſt ſome live long, and therefore thou preſumeſt for the like. Who would not beware of a mad man, who killeth all before him, as we ſee death doth every day? But as hogges ſtand by, whileſt ſome of themſelves are a killing, &amp; cry for company with that which is killed, and ſo goe away without any care or feare of the like; ſo it is with moſt of us, wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bemoane for our friends, whom the Lord calls, but never conſider, that the next day the like is to befall us. Seeing therefore we muſt goe out of the world to make account, let us not deferre time to caſt off ſinne, leſt wee be forced to carry it to judgement: A ſhip may be overloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and overburdened; ſo may the ſoule be, if a man heape up ſinne never ſo faſt, it may be the Lord will never puniſh in this life, that after death he may be damned: <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned,</hi>

It is not for ſmall conſequence, that daies, moneths and yeares are beſtowed upon us; ſeeing that all the worth and friendſhip the world can afford, cannot procure one weeke or a day to be added, to make up a mans life to be the full ſumme of an hundred yeares. The heavens ſerve for the framing of time, and God giveth life, that wee ſhould not loſe the uſe of it. The Philoſophers ſearching out what time was, found it to be (<hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus motus)</hi> the counter of celeſtiall motions;<note place="margin">Ariſt.

                     <note place="margin">Revel. 2, 21.</note> deſires them to conſider her fearefull example, in abuſing the time.

                  <p>But ſuch is the miſerable eſtate of our ſinfull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that our eye is evill, becauſe God is good,<note place="margin">We abuſe time as we do other bleſſings.</note> in our actions we are prodigal, becauſe <hi>God</hi> in boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is liberall; <hi>God</hi> giveth good things cheerefully, we receive them grudgingly, &amp; uſe them curſedly.

                  <note place="margin">Our faith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath two helpes.</note>Now becauſe the poſſibility of it hath cauſed many to erre, the Scripture hath given us two helpes to underprop our weakneſſe.

                  </note> and whatſoever he pleaſed he did with them: So Ieſus Chriſt being buried, made death it ſelfe a priſoner, and in ſtead of a debter, death found him a commander, and one that called him to account of all that was committed to his charge. Chriſt is our head, and his death and riſing was in our behalfe, and he is the beginning of our reſurrection: ſo as the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8262:49"/>
body cannot be drowned, ſo long as the head is above water, neither can our bodies be loſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt hath riſen from corruption: ſo that the Scripture concludeth, that although our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies remaine as yet in the duſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ: 2, 5.6.

               <p>But with this experience the Scripture would have us to conſider the power of God,<note place="margin">Matth: 22, 29.</note> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the <hi>changing of our vile body,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Philip: 3, 21.</note> it ſhall be <hi>by the mighty power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelfe.</hi> Indeede if our reſurrection were in the power of any except God himſelfe, we had reaſon to doubt it, becauſe wee could ſee no likelihood of it.<note place="margin">Luke 1.34, 37.</note> The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> wondered how ſhe ſhould conceive, <hi>not knowing a man,</hi> the Angel anſwered, that <hi>with God nothing is impoſsible.</hi> When the Lord promiſed that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have a ſonne,<note place="margin">Rom: 4.19, 20, 21.</note> hee neither feared the deadneſſe of himſelfe, nor the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and age of his wife, but was ſtrengthened in the faith, and <hi>gave glory to God, being fully aſſured, that he who had promiſed was able to performe it:</hi> and the reaſon which made <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up his ſonne, and yet to beleeve the promiſed bleſſing to be performed in him, was (ſaith the Apoſtle) becauſe he conſidered that <hi>God was able

As a Bridegroome in ſolemnizing his marriage hath juſt reaſon to take notice of them, that tooke notice and prepared for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and without regard of others, ſtoppe all wayes for their admittance: So ſhall our Lord in his comming take into his owne company and fellowſhip them that loved and longed for his comming,<note place="margin">2 Tim: 4, 8.</note> where wicked men ſhall not come in the aſſembly of the righteous,<note place="margin">Pſal 1, 5. 2 Theſſ. 1, 9.</note> but ſhall bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</p>
                  <p>After judgement is the Marriage betweene Chriſt and his ſervants, who in this life ſtand eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed unto him by faith and truth, and waite for the joyfull meeting; after which they ſhall not be longing in love, nor ſeparate for a time, but ſhall enjoy his bleſſed preſence and company, and (as husband and ſpouſe) love and live together for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

delivered from ſinne and corruption, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to righteouſneſſe and immortality.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly to teach us, (if it were poſſible) how great the bond of this union is, neere is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of friendly love, yet naturall love is a ſtricter bond, which maketh us to account the fleſh and blood of our kindred, as if it were our owne: But above all, the love betweene man and wife muſt cauſe to relinquiſh and quite the ſociety and company of all others, that they may ſhew that all pleaſure the world can give or friendſhip of all others, are onely as ſalves for neceſſitie, and to be deſpiſed in compariſon of this bond betweene man and wife.

                     <hi>As the father

loveth and hath compaſsion on his ſonne, ſo hath the Lord on thoſe that feare him:</hi> The Lord thinketh the love great which the mother hath to the childe, asking, <hi>if ſhe can forſake it,</hi>

In this life we love the Lord, but in the great meeting and marriage our love ſhall increaſe to ſuch a height, which now paſſeth our underſtanding.

And then ſhall wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how dearely the Lord hath loved us, and comprehend that for which wee are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Philip 3, 11.</note> The manifeſtation hereof doth better befit the ſolemnity of our ſpirituall marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; for as the perſonall meeting of lovers increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth love, and the apteſt time that their love ſhould ſhew itſelfe to the beholders; ſo in our meeting of Chriſt, our love ſhall be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,

and it is the fitteſt time in which the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love of Chriſt and his members ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; which love, how great it is now on Chriſts, and ſhall be then on our part, is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be underſtood, becauſe love cannot bee underſtood, but in ſuch meaſure as it is felt.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our remaining with Chriſt in glory, is compared to a mariage ſolemnitie, to teach us that the joyes of heaven are communicate, and many made partakers of them. In Mariages, all the friends and gueſts are partakers of the ſame intertainment with the Bridegroome, (and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly honoured with his ſervice,) partakers of ſhowes made to delight the eye, of voyces and melodious harmonies for the eare, with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that are knowne to give moſt pleaſure and content, for ſuch loving ſocieties; but aboue all, the particular love, they have unto the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, whoſe voyce they rejoyce to heare, and whom they both honour and delight to ſee, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that ſolemne honour and publick reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. In like manner, after the great judgement, we ſhall goe into eternall joy, and all be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame glory: and to reach the ſimilitude further, Chriſt ſaith to them that he ſhall find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their Lampes,<note place="margin">Luke 12, 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord when he commeth ſhall finde waking; verily I ſay unto you, he will gird himſelfe about, and make them ſit downe at table, and will come forth and ſerue them.</hi> And to the end, that his Diſciples might reiect the ambitious conceites of worldly honour,<note place="margin">Luk, 22, 27.</note> he ſaith unto them, <hi>Who is greater, he that ſitteth

Of

all our comforts and pleaſures in this life, the gall and bitterneſſe is incloſed in death, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, before it approach neare, is bitter unto us, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 41.1. the comming terrible, no fence is able to holde it out, ſo long as the gappes of ſinne attend to receive it; when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, it divideth us from friends, goods, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, pleaſures, and ſo maketh a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife, yea betweene ſoule and body, body and life.

And when we are invited to a marriage, to remember the day of the marriage of the Bridegroome, when his friends ſhall enter in, and fooliſh men be ſhut without doores. Theſe things Chriſt teacheth under the ſimilitude of a mariage, that in all ſuch wee may call to minde that mariage, which ſinne cannot divorce, nor death make void. And that we may doe this the better, the Scripture hath laid leſſons in our way, which we ſtand in neede of, by ſeeking of which wee may finde ſomewhat for our eternall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The duties required of man and wife may be learned by the actions of God &amp; his Church; the love of the man to the wife is taught by the love of Chriſt to his Church,<note place="margin">Epheſ 5.22, 23, &amp;c.</note> when he gave his life rather than it ſhould be loſt: how tenderly they ſhould ſhew themſelves in all their actions, is taught by Chriſts nouriſhing and cheriſhing the Church. And on the other part, the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reverence the woman ought to have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8262:71"/>
her husband, is taught by the ſubjection of the Church unto Chriſt, who onely hath an eye to him, and deſireth to be governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his direction. It is an heavenly patterne ſo to governe our ſelves as we have Chriſt for an example; and on the other part, we wrong our ſelves in mariage, when we bereave our ſelves of this heavenly comfort; for this is onely the way to make our mariage comfortable and heavenly, often to call to remembrance the union of Chriſt to his Church, and eſpecially to our ſoules; and according as we are dealt with, and behave our ſelves in the ſpirituall mariage, ſo to frame our lives and actions in the duties of mariage accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame example. I dare boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the name of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note> that he who ſanctifieth his mariage, in walking after this rule, peace ſhall be on him in this life, and mercy ſhall be his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the life to come, in being admitted to that ſociety of mariage with Chriſt in heaven, which hee ſo much loved, and imitated whileſt hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon earth.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould take a ſurvey of many maried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and enquire if they learne and practiſe any thing according to the rule of Chriſt and his Church, I ſhould finde them of another ſpirit; that where Chriſt appointeth their life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of heaven, they live in imitation of hell, as if they were bound together to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters one to another. The unquiet lives of many doe ſhew that Satan hath gotten power to curſe them, and when all things elſe doe pleaſure
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8262:72"/>
both, they finde want of nothing but love and quietneſſe: Is the God of peace and love dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with ſuch a couple? No ſure, it is the enemy of peace: Or can we exhort them to love their neighbour, and be tender-hearted to him, when they hate and torment their owne fleſh? Love is a marke of Chriſts ſcholler; and it is certaine that he muſt be taught and led by Satans overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hand, that beginneth hatred ſo neere home, as to be enemie unto their heart which God hath appointed to lye in his owne boſome. No fault, but it can pretend juſt ground, and married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples can pretend reaſon too. But will a man be angry, if the one hand cut the other, ſeeing they are both alike his owne? and ſhould hee be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry though faults happen among them? muſt he fall at variance for every fault? What ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, if the Lord ſhould for every fault ſhew his wrath againſt him? Or if there were cauſe given, ſhould hee then be angry and ſhew hatred? This is not the example of our Saviour, who loved every member of his Church, and gave his life for them, even when they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and did what they could to offend him. If the fault be in the wives carriage, St. <hi>Paul</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,<note place="margin">Col. 3.19.</note> yet to love them, and be not bitter unto them, alwayes remembring the example of Chriſt, who laboured to cleanſe his Church, and to make it without ſpot or blame.<note place="margin">Eph 5 26, 27.</note> If the fault bee in the men, and they be untoward, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> counſelleth the women,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1.</note> that by all meanes they ſubject themſelves to their husbands, that

though they were infidels, yet they might be wonne by the converſation of their wives. There is no place for contention betweene man and wife, all ſhould be love: and if the maried would take care to behave themſelves like Chriſtians in their houſes towards themſelves, wee ſhould not ſee or heare them ſo often in the ſtreets behaving themſelves like Turkes towards others, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Satan to goe betweene them and the bleſſing of their mariage.</p>

               <p>SEeing that by entring into the Mariage-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the Bridegroome is ſignified unto us the receiving of the poſſeſſion of our eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8262:81"/>
it followeth that the voice of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or complaint of the damned cannot reach thither, for nothing ſhall be heard in it but the voice of joy and gladneſſe, neither ſhall any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be given unto them: But if any anſwer were to be given them, it would be like this, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi> So that no meanes can availe either in judgement or after, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſhall be denied both the helpe of charitable men, and of a moſt mercifull God.</p>

and ſo receive anſwer without any reaſon added, becauſe they would not harken unto him, when with reaſons he moved them. Laſtly, whileſt they have an extraordinary demaund to others, to be furniſhed with their proviſion, they receive an ordinary anſwer, for every one thinkes they haue too little for themſelues: but when they have an ordinary petition to God, to open heaven unto them; they receiue an extraordinary anſwer, for God never diſclaimeth them that do drawe neere unto him. I omit the application of theſe, I onely would by theſe, as by the reſt of the particulars of this Parable, give a taſte of the great wiſdome of our Saviour who preached it, and what concent one word giueth to another.</p>

               <p>THeſe words are the 3. part of this Parable, containing the application of it.

Two times already (as I ſaid in the beginning) hath Chriſt in this ſame Sermon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſame warning. Now becauſe the danger is great, even the damnation of every ſoule that labours not to prevent it, and men are careleſſe and feareleſſe of unſeene and unfelt dangers, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preacheth it the third time, and by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon compariſon labours to imprint it in the mindes of his hearers.<note place="margin">Iob 33 14.29 30.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth once or twice, and a man perceiveth it not, yea (and being abundant in compaſsion) will labour twice or thrice with a man, that he may turne backe his ſoule from the pit, to be illuminate in the light of the living.</hi> As a carefull Captaine, before hee betake him to reſt, conſidering the great danger of his army, if they become ſleepy and careleſſe, will give charge that the watches be placed; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with direction and intreaty, will goe in perſon, to ſee his owne ſatisfaction and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: So our Lord Ieſus Chriſt being to leave this world, and conſidering the watchfulneſſe and labour of our ſpirituall enemies, ſeeking to devoure us, which may haſtily be done, if once we be taken at unawares; he often exhorts us to ſtand to our guard, and at laſt in his owne perſon ſets the watch, and ſeales it with a charge of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted upon thoſe that neglect.

               <p>This exhortation [Watch therefore] ſpringeth from many rootes, each wherof leadeth us to this fruite, even from every maine particular in this Parable, which proceeding along by the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of time, are as ſo many motives and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers that wee watch and awaite for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt to us. The great River <hi>Nilus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth water and ſtrength from many ſprings, all which concurring overflow much of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and cauſeth fruitfulneſſe: So the former doctrines of this Parable, all concurre in one, and taking their current through the uncertainty of our life, or Chriſts comming, doe overflow the ſoule,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8262:86"/>
and make it fruitfull, cauſing us to walke worthy of our calling, and to watch for Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The greateſt argument to move us to watchfulneſſe, and carefulneſſe of a Chriſtian life, is the uncertainty of our life, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall danger we ſtand in, to be arreſted by death, and ſo brought preſently to a fearefull account. He that feareth the thiefe to come at every houre of the night, will be ſure to ſpend the whole night in watching: Wee are ever in danger, yea in the midſt of life we be in death: and therefore while we live, our ſoules ſhould continually watch for the time that our Lord Ieſus ſhall appeare for our deliverance out of this mortall life. Therefore when our Lord exhorteth us to watch, he giveth this for a reaſon, [We know not the day, &amp;c.] And becauſe, of all the fooliſhneſſe, and miſerable eſtate of the fooliſh Virgins, this is moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that beginning and labouring for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they ſhould notwithſtanding allow a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed prodigality, to conſume an uncertaine time, and ſo be taken at unawares in careleſneſſe, loſe their expected credit and benefit, to their great ſhame and confuſion: ſo ſhould we ſtand in awe, and watch, leſt that day come upon us as a ſnare, when we leaſt thinke of it, [For we know not the day, &amp;c.] And this is the particular that Chriſt urgeth out of this Parable, and which hee maketh expreſſe uſe of.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing there are many other circumſtances in it which doe urge this exhortation, and by good conſequence conclude the ſame doctrine, it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8262:87"/>
is not unfitting to ſet them downe, as ſo many hands, laying one and the ſame burthen of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary watchfulneſſe upon us: but ſo as they may be linked with this maine reaſon (of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the time) to give greater ſtrength unto them. When all our reaſons are ſeaſoned and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the uncertaine time of death, they give no other reliſh, nor bring out any other effect in an underſtanding ſoule, than warineſſe and watchfulneſſe in all things, according to the wiſe mans ſaying, <hi>Remember death, and thou ſhalt never ſinne, Eccleſiasticus</hi> 7.36.</p>
               <p>There have been ſix principall doctrines in this Parable, which all concurre to teach us this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.<note place="margin">Theſe reaſons I have ſet down thus for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake, which may be eaſily drawne into ſyllogiſmes.</note> From the firſt Verſe. Heaven is our native Country, for which wee are brought up; now we are children of the kingdome, and are pilgrims in another Countrey, and have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty when the Lord will tranſlate us from this miſerable eſtate, to receive our mercifull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: and therefore wee ſhould watch, ſeeing we know not the day, &amp;c. From the ſecond Verſe. We heard that few were to be ſaved, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of damnation is an equall enemy to all, and at all times ready to take holde of us: therefore we ſhould be watchfull ſeeing we know not, &amp;c. From the third Verſe. We finde it true, that moſt of men content themſelves with a ſhew of grace and preparation, and ſo labour with cunning and induſtry that they may be damned, and with this ſhew conſume the time, which they neither know nor have power of: and therefore we ſhould give
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8262:87"/>
labour, that we prove not of this graceleſſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but watch, for we know not, &amp;c. From the fifth Verſe. The time of our life and of Chriſts ſtay is beſtowed upon us, to the end that we may make ready againſt he come, which if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day, or an houre, we know not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould watch, ſeeing we know not, &amp;c. From the fift and ſixt Verſes. Security is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon forerunner of danger, and the uſher which maketh way to deſtruction, which is commonly neareſt when it ſeemeth to be furtheſt off, but when it comes is uncertaine, but ever doubtfull: and therefore we ſhould be ever upon our guard, and watch, ſeeing we know not, &amp;c. From the following Verſes is by reaſons concluded, that there is neither time to provide and prepare, nor any helpe to be hoped for, from God or man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of death, which is ever waiting to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us to judgement: And therefore we ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prepare and watch, ſeeing we know neither the day nor houre when the Sonne of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>
               <p>Now we are in particular to conſider the main reaſon; we know not the day nor the houre, when the Sonne of man commeth. Secondly, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to all this Parable, to expound and urge this exhortation, <hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon imports two things: Firſt, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Chriſts comming: ſecondly, the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the time to our knowledge. The firſt is taken as granted &amp; beleeved, being promiſed by Chriſt oftentimes before. The ſecond, on which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8262:88"/>
we preſume moſt, though wee know it leaſt, is proved by this compariſon, in the unexpected coming of the Bridegroom, (&amp; in the chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by the example of the ſodaine overtaking the world by the flood not looked for, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day that <hi>Noah</hi> entred into the Arke: and by the ſodain deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sodom,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.23.</note> not likely nor looked for an houre before it came, for the Sunne ſhined brightly upon it. And laſtly, in all the ſaid places, our Lord promiſeth, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhall be (for ſodainneſſe) in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that as the world had not a dayes knowledge of the flood before it came, nor the Sodomites an houres warning of their deſtruction before it came, ſo no man ſhall know the day, nor the houre when the Sonne of man ſhall come.</p>

judgement, even the very word of it is terrible, becauſe of the fearefull ſights we ſhall ſee, and the glory which Chriſt ſhall ſhew, that reprobate men ſhall feare nothing ſo much, as the preſence of him who ſitteth upon the throne.

                  <p>The word is uſed from warfare, in which the armie ever count themſelves to be in danger, (if the enemie be not certainly knowne to be farre off,) and therefore adventure not to ſleepe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpies appointed and ſet in the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places, to perceive the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and with a loud voice, when danger is at hand, may ſound an alarme to awake others to ſtand to their defence.

And for the better performance of the charge (which ſtood them all on their lives) it was counted dangerous to truſt a whole nights watching to one man, they divided the night into foure parts, by the name of watches, though in theſe parts of the world it was neceſſary that the watches be changed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than foure times.

Outward, that he be well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with armour to defend himſelfe, &amp; be ready to joyne in the common defence. Laſtly, in his charge hee muſt be faithfull, that is, diligent to mark &amp; ſpye out all danger, &amp; give true notice of it unto others. All ſorts of perſons who are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to watch, in whatſoever kind of charge, muſt be thus prepared &amp; appointed, or in kind anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hereunto, which by compariſon herewith may eaſily appeare: Much more the ſervant of Chriſt, who hath the Image of God in cuſtody, a ſoule &amp; body appointed for a heavenly kingdom, continually aſſaulted, &amp; in danger to be taken by Satan, detained by wickednes, &amp; to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted unbaleable unto the torments of hell for ever.</p>
